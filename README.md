# Visual-Communication-and-Information-Design


The purpose of this study is to carry out an analysis of more than one datasets and present our findings in the form of visualizations and a report along with an analysis.  

This analysis was carried out using Python, as I believe is better suited for data analysis and statistical methods.  
In addition, for the visualization part I have used Tableau and Python. Using python’s libraries like matplolib and pandas you cannot create advance visualizations so I have used those to summarize and make my datasets easier to read and understand. The tableau software was used for the more detailed and advanced visualizations which Python language alone could not create.    
 
The datasets I used were based on the U.S police deaths from 1791 until 2016, the police killings during 2015.  

The primary source of the police deaths data is the Officer Down Memorial Page, started in 1996 by a college student who is now a police officer and who continues to maintain the database (dmil, n.d.). The data consists of the person name, police department, year, date, cause of death etc. Overall it consists all the basic information of the deceased. 

Additionally, the police killings dataset contains the data behind the story Where Police Have Killed Americans in 2015 and it’s based on the Guardian’s database on police killings to census data from the American Community Survey (dmil, 2015). It also consists of the tract population of state, ethnicity and income of the person. The primary purpose of census tracts is to provide a stable set of geographic units for the 
presentation of statistical data. Census tracts generally have a population size between 1,200 and 8,000 people, with an optimum size of 4,000 people.
